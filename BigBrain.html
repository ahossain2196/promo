        Imagine you have an assignment and you have to innovate a coffee cup,
        <br><br>
        what would you do? If you were me, you would just look at
        <br><br>
        one object, and use that to as in innovation for your coffee cup.
        <br><br>
         The first thing I saw was I fire extinguisher, so I got to work.
        <br><br>
        This is usually how I come up with ideas for my assingments,
        <br><br>
        I know having a mindset like that is kinda crazy, but it's actually
        <br><br>
        fun to do.  </span> </p>
