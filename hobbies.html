    <p><span style="color: antiquewhite; "> Currently, my favorite hobby is playing football. The day I first played
        <br><br>
        football... I didn't really like it. I didn't think I would even TRY to go to the
        <br><br>
        football team because I thought I was weak. But after a
        <br><br>
        couple days of playing flag football in elementary after school,
        <br><br>
        I started to actually like playing football. It was then in
        <br><br>
        6th grade when I decided I was going to play football.
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        Some of my other hobbies are videogames
        <br><br>
        (Don't worry it's not Fortnite... its Minecraft),
        <br><br>
        Going on Snapchat, Listening to music, and just
        <br><br>
        hanging out with my friends.
